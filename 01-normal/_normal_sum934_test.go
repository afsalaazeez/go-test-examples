Test Cases:
    [TestSum]

Scenario 1: Normal operation with positive integers

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the Sum function when both inputs are positive integers.
Execution:
    Arrange: No special arrangement is needed as the function takes two integer parameters directly.
    Act: Invoke the Sum function with two positive integers.
    Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to check that the output of the function matches the expected sum of the two input integers.
Validation:
    The assertion is checking whether the function correctly adds two positive integers. This is a basic functionality of the Sum function and is crucial to the application's behavior.

Scenario 2: Normal operation with negative integers

Details:
    Description: This test checks the functionality of the Sum function when both inputs are negative integers.
Execution:
    Arrange: No special arrangement is needed as the function takes two integer parameters directly.
    Act: Invoke the Sum function with two negative integers.
    Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to check that the output of the function matches the expected sum of the two input integers.
Validation:
    The assertion is checking whether the function correctly adds two negative integers. This functionality is important to handle cases where the inputs might be negative.

Scenario 3: Normal operation with zero

Details:
    Description: This test checks the functionality of the Sum function when one of the inputs is zero.
Execution:
    Arrange: No special arrangement is needed as the function takes two integer parameters directly.
    Act: Invoke the Sum function with one positive integer and zero.
    Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to check that the output of the function matches the expected sum of the two input integers.
Validation:
    The assertion is checking whether the function correctly handles the case where one of the inputs is zero. This is a special case that needs to be handled correctly.

Scenario 4: Normal operation with large integers

Details:
    Description: This test checks the functionality of the Sum function when both inputs are large integers.
Execution:
    Arrange: No special arrangement is needed as the function takes two integer parameters directly.
    Act: Invoke the Sum function with two large integers.
    Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to check that the output of the function matches the expected sum of the two input integers.
Validation:
    The assertion is checking whether the function correctly adds two large integers. This is important for ensuring the function can handle large inputs.

Scenario 5: Error handling

Details:
    Description: This test checks the functionality of the Sum function when the sum of inputs exceeds the maximum integer value.
Execution:
    Arrange: No special arrangement is needed as the function takes two integer parameters directly.
    Act: Invoke the Sum function with two integers such that their sum exceeds the maximum integer value.
    Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to check that the function behaves as expected in this scenario.
Validation:
    The assertion is checking whether the function handles the case where the sum of inputs exceeds the maximum integer value. This is important for ensuring the function's robustness and reliability.
