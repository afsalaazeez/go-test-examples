Existing Test Information:
These test cases are already implemented and not included for test generation scenario:
File: go-test-examples/08-ginhttp/main_test.go
Test Cases:
    [TestPingRoute]

Scenario 1: Test that the /ping route returns the correct HTTP response code and body content

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check that the /ping route is correctly set up and that it returns the correct HTTP response code (200 OK) and body content ("pong").
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new HTTP GET request to the /ping route.
    Act: Serve the HTTP request using the router returned by the setupRouter function.
    Assert: Check that the HTTP response code is 200 and that the body content is "pong".
Validation:
    The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the /ping route as defined in the setupRouter function. The expected result is a HTTP 200 OK response code and a body content of "pong". This test is important to ensure that the /ping route is set up correctly and functioning as expected.

Scenario 2: Test that the router returned by the setupRouter function is not nil

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check that the setupRouter function returns a non-nil router.
Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is needed for this test.
    Act: Call the setupRouter function.
    Assert: Check that the returned router is not nil.
Validation:
    The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the setupRouter function, which should return a non-nil router. The expected result is a non-nil router. This test is important to ensure that the setupRouter function is working as expected and returning a valid router.

Scenario 3: Test that the router returned by the setupRouter function has the /ping route

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check that the router returned by the setupRouter function has the /ping route.
Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is needed for this test.
    Act: Call the setupRouter function.
    Assert: Check that the returned router has the /ping route.
Validation:
    The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the setupRouter function, which should return a router with the /ping route. The expected result is a router with the /ping route. This test is important to ensure that the setupRouter function is setting up the /ping route correctly.

// Since the error is related to go.mod file not found, it indicates that the go module is not initialized in the project.
// However, this error can be resolved outside of code by initializing go module using `go mod init <module_name>` in the terminal.
// After module initialization, the go.mod file will be created in the project root directory.
// Here is the correct code after considering all the instructions and reference provided.
